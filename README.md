# Mentoring-Process-Handbook

The purpose of this document is to streamline the mentoring process among the mentors and make sure to apply the process step by step.

**Greeting Meeting**
So in greeting meeting mentor first of all judge the mentee by some technical talk in order to make sure which plan will be executed to groom. And decide the senior evaluator which will be the part of evaluation throughout the training. 

**Clearly Communicate Company Culture**
This is very important to onboard the mentee with the company culture `Freedom with Responsibility and Accountability` and PQR structure before move to assign the training materials.

**Build Attitude Alongside Aptitude**
We all know the positive attitude is very important in a workplace like we are working in, so attitude building towards work and people is also the part of newcomers grooming.

**Three Parts Plan (A, B, C)**
As in greeting meeting you have to decide which plan is suitable for the mentee to indulge in training process, so the plan **A** is for the mentees who do not know the basics of web development and the plan **B** for the mentees having basic knowledge of JavaScript and web development. Plan **C** is for those guys who have experience in web development and also know the JavaScript frameworks. Note the plan `[A, B, C]` will be differentiated by the `complexity` of assignments and materials will be assigned during training.

**Three Steps Evaluations** 
As our training manual is divided into three parts (HTML/CSS, JavaScript and Framework React) so mentor is responsible to evaluate the mentee after completion of mentioned parts assignments in front of senior evaluator using metrics which is defined google sheet **[Todo]**

**Feedback Email** 
Mentor is responsible to share the feedback via email to HR, Haris Bhai and Jabir Hussain after every evaluation.

**Raise Flag in Case of Slow Progress**
In case there is some problem in training progress mentor is responsible to raise a flag and involve the senior evaluator to clearly communicate the red flag.
